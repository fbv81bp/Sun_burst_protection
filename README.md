# Sun burst protection

I read this Wired article on Sun bursts:
https://www.wired.com/story/sun-storm-end-civilization/
and thought I post another concept, that is actually compatible to capacitors, ie. the two extend eachother well.

The solution is to use the shielding effect of the twisted wire pair concept to protect sensitive wire loops by winding a circle of ground wire around them. This will have a smaller resistance and take the bulk of any induction, that would otherwise affect the system to be protected.

Why the capacitors mentioned in the Wired article are not enough protection on their own is because they have a voltage potential limit, and in case of a Sun burst, according to the article, we are dealing with many times larger powers than a lightning. This would easily penetrate any capacitor's insulation, and still burn the transformers, as well as the capacitors.

Yet!

If the capacitors are combined with the ground loop, then the maximum voltage over them will be the multiple of the immense current running through the ground loop and this loops near to zero resistance! The capacitors should possibly be planned to be able to withstand that one already.
